## .env

You will need a discord token for testing your code. We will provide one for the duration of this workshop.

## Adding a new command

1. Create a file the src/commands/ directory
2. Label it <command_title>.ts
3. If you're new to discord.js, copy over the code from one of the existing command files into your new file.
4. Change the code to your specifications.
5. Run `npm run start-full` to test and run your command!
